By default, when using webdeploy.exe,  your application will get deployed to a virtual directory similar to ApplicationName_deploy.
If you donâ€™t like this, you can change by adding the following to your .csproj file:

    <DeployIisAppPath>Default Web Site/</DeployIisAppPath>

This is a per configuration setting, so you must add it to each configuration.  For example:
  
    <PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'UAT|AnyCPU'">
        <OutputPath>bin\</OutputPath>
        <DeployIisAppPath>Default Web Site/</DeployIisAppPath>
    </PropertyGroup>

This setting used to be available in the project properties within VS, but in VS2013 at least, it is not.
